# Medium Stats Insights

Medium Stats Insights is a chrome extension that help writers on Medium get more insights from the stats. You can add it to your chrome via [this link](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/medium-stats-insights/ajgkoiodkljabcgempdllhgkglaiipjb).

# Notice 

The development of versions prior to 1.1.1 of this plugin mainly involves minor modifications based on the [better-medium-stats](https://github.com/HcwXd/better-medium-stats) repository. We should respect the original work of the author. If you are using versions prior to 1.1.1, you may follow [my fork from better-medium-stats](https://github.com/tfrain/better-medium-stats) and the author's original repository.

For educational purposes, I aim to make more substantial changes in the subsequent versions, and you are welcomed to keep track of these developments. 

# TODO && Milestone 

- [ ] Add source information of the articles, distinguish paid articles
- [ ] Use Plasmo plugin framework
